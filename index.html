                    <h1>The First 25 Years</h1>
                    <strong><small>I grew up in the only major city in eastern Washington state, called Spokane.</strong></small> I am the younger of two siblings, my brother being 
                        my senior by about 4 years. My mom worked as a nurse(now retired) at a major hospital in town, while my dad worked (again, retired)
                        selling natural gas to large consumers such as paper plants, hospitals, etc.
                    <br>    
                        I was an above average student, but always found time for friends and sports in addition to the textbook. I played trombone
                        starting in 5th grade, and band was a large part of my life well into undergrad. In high school, video games were a big part of my life,
                        as Halo 3 and Rock Band with friends were everyday activities. After high school graduation in 2009, I attended Washington State University for a year, 
                        learning plenty about why I dislike Pullman(the campus town) in addition to my subject matter. By Thanksgiving 2009, I knew that
                        a change was required and I transferred to the University of Portland, a small catholic university on the north bank of the Wilamette.
                        I completed a B.S. degree in Civil Engineering, and focusing on geotechnical engineering. After graduation in 2014, I took a year off
                        to work and travel. I was accepted to the University of Washington(Seattle) masters program for geotechnical engineering, which I 
                        took on and completed in 2016. </small></strong>

                    <h1>Working Life</h1>

                    <strong>Ive been fortunate to have some great jobs along the way. The following is a breakdown, from first, to current.</strong>
                    <ol id="working-list">
                        <li>Lifeguard,Parks Department, Spokane WA</li>
                        <li>Lifeguard, A Golf and Country Club, Spokane WA</li>
                        <li>Pavement Rater, Spokane Streets, Spokane, WA</li>
                        <li>Geotechnical Intern, Geotech Engineering Firm, Spokane, WA</li>
                        <li>Geotechnical Engineer I, Large Environmental Firm, Seattle, WA</li>
                        <li>Field Engineer, Small specialty drilling contractor, Various</li>

                    </ol>

                    <p>After grad school, I took on my first real engineering job. The salary was low, but I worked
                        hard designing shoring systems for excavations. After a year or so, I decided it was time to try getting back to my
                        hometown of Spokane, so started applying in the area. I hired on at a drilling contractor that was based in Spokane, 
                        but it was a traveling job. I assisted with project management tasks for 6 months in upstate New York, 
                        followed by a 4 year stint in eastern San Diego county. This employer specialized in helicopter supported 
                        construction, which made for made for some interesting work. I flew in helicopters,
                        worked under a sky-crane (THEY ARE HUUUGE!!, see below), and have worked through some tough challenges to 
                        accomplish construction in such remote areas. 
                        <br>
                        Along the way, I met a fabulous human, a lawyer who lived a couple hours north of me. So every weekend, I would drive the company
                        car the 2 hours north to go on a date, and then stay the weekend, and now stay together for life. I proposed to Shelby in late 
                        September of last year, and we are scheduled to be maried in July of this year, shortly after my Coding Temple coding bootcamp concludes.

                    <h1>Soccer</h1>
                    <p>Growing up, I played tons of soccer. I became the regular starter in goal, and once that happened became a goalie for life. 
                        I have not played in a few years, but would love to continue playing and plan to join a mens league as life allows. After
                        falling in love with the game and not playing as frequently, I still wanted to witness some of the magic of the beautiful game.
                        I stumbled onto a smaller team from Wales that had just been promoted, and I loved their emblem/crest. That was it, and I was hooked. I 
                        still wake up early on Saturdays to watch Swansea City, win lose or draw. We have an exciting team that my see a return to the 
                        premier league under an exciting new manager and a young and improving side.
